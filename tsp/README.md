It's just a practice to solve the [TSP](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).

In my case the rules were essentially complicated. I've tried to imagine that the salesman travels by plane, and the distance is measured in money. So there're random one-directional flights from random cities to random cities for random price. And it's required to find the cheapiest path from a starting city back to the starting city through all the rest cities.
